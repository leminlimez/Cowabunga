# Cowabunga
A Jailed toolbox application for iOS 14.0-15.7.1 and 16.0-16.1.2 using [CVE-2022-46689](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213530).

Enable Notifications and set Location Services to **Always** to keep the app running in the background, keep the dock and folder background hidden, and prevent some sound effects from reverting.

Warning: Some changes are permanent on iOS 14.0-14.8.1

IPA available in the [Releases](https://github.com/leminlimez/Cowabunga/releases/latest) section.

## Installing
You can install through AltStore, Sideloadly, Xcode, or TrollStore (if your device supports it)

## Creating Custom Lock Animations
Lock animations are very simple to make. For the frames, each image must be named "trollformation" with a number afterwards (ie. trollformation1.png, trollformation2.png, trollformation3.png...). You can use up to 120 frames, though I am not sure of the exact size limit, which is probably much less.
**If your animation is not exactly 40 frames or you want to customize the display length of each frame, you need to define the animations.** This is very simple to do:
1. Create a json file named `animations.json`
2. Define the values. Format: `"Frame Number": Time Interval`
Example:
```
{
    "1": 0,
    "2": 0.025,
    "10": 0.01,
    "15": 0.025
}
```
**Explanation:**
You do not need to state the length of each frame. The only time that absolutely needs to be defined is the first frame. If you did not set a time for the frame, Cowabunga will use the time from the last frame.
The `Time Interval` is how long the frame stays on the screen for.
**Important:** The frame number must be a string (meaning in quotes) because of how json decoding works.

## Building
Just build like a normal Xcode project. Sign using your own team and bundle identifier. You can also build the IPA file with `ipabuild.sh`.
